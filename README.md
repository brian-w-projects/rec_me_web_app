# rec_me_web_app
Web app for viewing and posting recs. Works with recommend_me website

This project uses Flask, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, Redis, Celery and JQuery to
 create a simple responsive web app that interacts with my Recommend Me
 RESTful API. The full site is live at https://rec-me.herokuapp.com. Use of
 the web app requires the creation of an account on the web site.

The following public account can be used for exploratory purposes:
username: 
password:

The web app is not currently live. The address will be posted here when it is.

Upcoming Updates:
1. Less/Css styling
2. QOL improvements
